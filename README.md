# [CS 166] InfoSecurity Blog Project
This project was built using JavaEE JSP/Servlet and a MySQL server. The focus of the project is not on the functionality (only MMFs are supported - user/admin authentication, creating/editing/deleting posts), but rather on the implementation of information security features. Those include:

 * Password hashing with SHA-512 and a SecureRandom 256-bit salt
 * XSS Attack demonstration and prevention
 * SQL Injection Attack demonstration and prevention
 * Defacing example via XSS Attack
 * Implementation of a role-based access control system
 * and more
